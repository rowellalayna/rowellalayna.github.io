# Welcome to my website!

My name is Alayna. I was born in rural northwest Ohio. When I am not working, you can usually find me spending time with family and friends. I find extraordinary joy in the people I love, in live shows, in being outside and in various other introverted activities. I am a lifelong learner and steadfast advocate in most areas of my life.

I found a career in helping people rehabilitate some of life's most essential functions; speech-language pathologists in the medical field manage deficits in speech articulation, language, cognition, vocal function, and swallowing. I have practiced across the continuum of healthcare in rural communities, including Levels 1 and 3 Trauma hospitals, community hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. I have now gone back to school to get my PhD after practicing as a clinician.

My research interests are in dysphagia, or in disordered physiology of the swallow mechanism. If we cannot eat and drink safely and efficiently, a multitude of life-threatening complications can arise. Swallowing is at the crux of many different physician specialties including neurology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, pulmonology, and rehabilitative medicine. This leads to dysphagia management being complex, under-studied, and difficult for patients to navigate within our current healthcare system. I am particularly passionate about understanding neurological and auto-immune etiologies to dysphagia, enhancing inter-disciplinary collaboration and critical-thinking patterns related to patient care, and improving quality of life for patients in under-served areas. 

On this website, I offer insights on subjects that matter to me, updates to my PhD journey, ongoing research, and information on upcoming events I will be involved in. I invite you to explore and learn with me.
Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.alayna.rowell@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
