I find extraordinary joy in the people I love, in live shows, in being outside and in various other introverted activities. I am a lifelong learner and steadfast advocate in most areas of my life.\nI found a career in helping people rehabilitate some of life’s most essential functions; speech-language pathologists in the medical field manage deficits in speech articulation, language, cognition, vocal function, and swallowing. I have practiced across the continuum of healthcare in rural communities, including Levels 1 and 3 Trauma hospitals, community hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. I have now gone back to school to get my PhD after practicing as a clinician.\nMy research interests are in dysphagia, or in disordered physiology of the swallow mechanism. If we cannot eat and drink safely and efficiently, a multitude of life-threatening complications can arise. Swallowing is at the crux of many different physician specialties including neurology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, pulmonology, and rehabilitative medicine. This leads to dysphagia management being complex, under-studied, and difficult for patients to navigate within our current healthcare system. I am particularly passionate about understanding neurological and auto-immune etiologies to dysphagia, enhancing inter-disciplinary collaboration and critical-thinking patterns related to patient care, and improving quality of life for patients in under-served areas.\nOn this website, I offer insights on subjects that matter to me, updates to my PhD journey, ongoing research, and information on upcoming events I will be involved in. I invite you to explore and learn with me. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "2025-24-03\nWith this blog, I plan to follow Jeff Leek’s advice in  How To Be A Modern Scientist . He recommends using a scientific blog to:\n• Show off storytelling or communication skills,\n• Show off data visualization skills,\n• Teach people how to do some kind of analysis, and\n• Discuss important issues that are relevant in my industry.\nMy field of clinical practice and research is often silo-ed, and so finding ways to translate findings from inside the field to those outside of it, and vice versa, will be a large part of my future career. A key theme of  How To Be A Modern Scientist  emphasizes the role that new technology can play in research while maintaining rigor and transparency. Further, Jeff Leek argues that new technology cannot just be used, it must also be easy to understand and access. This aligns with my personal goals; as researchers, we can embrace change and integrate new tools for betterment of knowledge sharing and efficiency. An example of a new platform I learned at the beginning of my research program is Slack, which Jeff Leek discusses in relevance to internal scientific communication. In reference to content aimed at external audiences, a tangible way to make content more approachable is to ‘entertain’ rather than teach; indeed, all of my favorite instructors have been conversational in their approach rather than dogmatic. I appreciate the perspective that Jeff Leek offers, and I aim to use the advice in his book to reach fellow providers, community members, and researchers of different backgrounds when I speak about my research."
