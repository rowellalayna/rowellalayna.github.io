My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

By gathering information from a variety of sources, including my own memories, written accounts, and oral histories, I hope to shed new light on this important period in Middle-earth’s history and provide valuable insights into the motivations and actions of the various players involved.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

When I am not working, you can usually find me spending time with family and friends. I find extraordinary joy in the people I love, in live shows, in being outside and in various other introverted activities. I am a lifelong learner and steadfast advocate in most areas of my life.\nI found a career in helping people rehabilitate some of life’s most essential functions; speech-language pathologists in the medical field manage deficits in speech articulation, language, cognition, vocal function, and swallowing. I have practiced across the continuum of healthcare in rural communities, including Levels 1 and 3 Trauma hospitals, community hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient clinics and inpatient rehabilitation facilities. I have now gone back to school to get my PhD after practicing as a clinician.\nMy research interests are in dysphagia, or in disordered physiology of the swallow mechanism. If we cannot eat and drink safely and efficiently, a multitude of life-threatening complications can arise. Swallowing is at the crux of many different physician specialties including neurology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, pulmonology, and rehabilitative medicine. This leads to dysphagia management being complex, under-studied, and difficult for patients to navigate within our current healthcare system. I am particularly passionate about understanding neurological and auto-immune etiologies to dysphagia, enhancing inter-disciplinary collaboration and critical-thinking patterns related to patient care, and improving quality of life for patients in under-served areas.\nOn this website, I offer insights on subjects that matter to me, updates to my PhD journey, ongoing research, and information on upcoming events I will be involved in. I invite you to explore and learn with me. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
