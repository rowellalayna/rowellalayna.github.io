I find extraordinary joy in the people I love, in live shows, in being outside and in various other introverted activities. I am a lifelong learner and steadfast advocate in most areas of my life.\nI found a career in helping people rehabilitate some of life’s most essential functions; speaking, thinking, eating, and drinking. Speech-language pathologists in the medical field manage disorders of motor-speech, cognition, language, voice, and swallowing. These disorders occur accross a wide array of etiologies; causes may include structural, neurological, or systemic disruption. I have practiced across the continuum of healthcare in rural communities, and I am now getting my PhD with a focus on swallowing physiology.\nIf we cannot eat and drink safely and efficiently, a multitude of life-threatening complications can arise. The oropharyngeal and pharyngoesophageal swallowing mechanisms are at the crux of many different physician specialties. This leads to dysphagia management being complex, under-studied, and difficult for patients to navigate within our current healthcare system. I am particularly passionate about understanding neurological and auto-immune etiologies to dysphagia, enhancing inter-disciplinary collaboration and critical-thinking patterns related to patient care, and improving quality of life for patients in under-served areas.\nOn this website, I offer insights on subjects that matter to me. I discuss updates to my PhD journey, ongoing research, and information on upcoming events I will be involved in. I invite you to explore and learn with me! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Before my undergraduate degree, I had no tangible understanding of research or the career it could yield. I grew up in northwest Ohio with my parents being the first in my family to pursue baccalaureate and associate’s degrees. While my undergraduate degree introduced me to research, it still didn’t feel like a safe career choice because I had never seen anybody go through the process.\nThe beginning of my clinical career was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic. I worked for a rural contract company, and our department covered SLP services for most medical facilities within a 25-30 mile radius. I immediately felt that I was ill-equipped to manage dysphagia; I had one graduate course on swallowing rehabilitation and one medical internship, but very little foundational knowledge to support my interactions with the plethora of specialties that my patients required. I pursued extensive self-learning in dysphagia management and I used this knowledge to improve my clinical practice. However, when attempting to build treatment plans based in pathophysiology, I regularly encountered barriers in a multitude of ways. During my five years as a clinician, I managed dysphagia in 5 different hospital buildings, 3 different skilled nursing facilities and 3 outpatient centers across rural Ohio and Michigan. I realized that SLPs do not receive adequate training in dysphagia management because swallowing research itself is in its infancy. Our patients desperately need perspectives other than speech-language pathology to manage their dysphagia, and the field of dysphagia management desperately needs interdisciplinary collaboration to elucidate research in both normal and disordered swallowing physiology.\nAnd so, I have started my PhD :)"

    "text": "2025-24-03\nWith this blog, I plan to follow Jeff Leek’s advice in  How To Be A Modern Scientist. He recommends using a scientific blog to:\n• Show off storytelling or communication skills,\n• Show off data visualization skills,\n• Teach people how to do some kind of analysis, and\n• Discuss important issues that are relevant in my industry.\nFinding ways to translate findings from inside my field to those outside of it, and vice versa, will be a large part of my future career. A key theme of  How To Be A Modern Scientist  emphasizes the role that new technology can play in research while maintaining rigor and transparency. Further, Jeff Leek argues that new technology cannot just be used, it must also be easy to understand and access. This aligns with my personal goals; as researchers, we can embrace change and integrate new tools for betterment of knowledge sharing and efficiency. In reference to content aimed at external audiences, a tangible way to make content more approachable is to ‘entertain’ rather than teach; indeed, all of my favorite instructors have been conversational in their approach rather than dogmatic. I appreciate the perspective that Jeff Leek offers, and I aim to use the advice in his book to reach fellow providers, community members, and researchers of different backgrounds when I speak about my research."
